### TDD (opinionated approach)
TDD is an iterative development process that emphasizes creating automated tests before writing code. 
This approach ensures that the code you write is focused on meeting specific requirements 
and that it can be thoroughly tested before being integrated into the larger system.

_Don't worry if code is not written in Scala, you should grasp the concept_
